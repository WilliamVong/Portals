<h2 class="content-title">Intellectual Change</h2>
<div class="content">Before the “time of the Rona”, I did not have a lot of time on my hands. A normal day would start by my waking up in the morning at 6:10, leaving the house at 6:30 to get to Stuyvesant at 7:30. From there, school would last until 3:35, where I would commute back to the public library, where I would stay until 5:45, where I made the final leg of my “journey” and arrived at home at 6:00. From there, I would do my homework and have little time for anything else. Therefore, I was not able to advance my curiosity for knowledge far past the edges of the sheets of paper that I did my homework on.</div><img class="img1" src="assets/subway.jpg"><br><div></div>
<img class="img2" src="assets/quarantine.jpg"><div class="content">And then the Portal opened, on the 23rd of March 2020. My commute disappeared into thin air (along with 1/3rd of the subway cars). Classes, taught through Zoom, were irregular and did not happen even once every day (at least for me). Tout à coup, I had access to an unimaginable amount of free time! What should I do with this time? Should I rest, chat, and play and take life easy (as most Stuyvesant students, if not all, would like to do)? It was what I did at first. I read New York Times (thus the inspiration for the fonts), and this is where I found an article about edX, where I signed up for my first online class outside of school boundaries, CS50x.</div>
<div class="content">CS50x, as is stated on their homepage, is an “Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming”. “Oh, this will be easy!”, I thought, blissfully unaware of the syllabus contents, or of the name of the school that was offering the course. It wasn’t even a few days until I was regretting my arrogance towards this course, while struggling through Caesar. While I did complete this course, and eventually another one, CS50AI, my attitude towards everything changed dramatically. </div><img class="img1" src="assets/cs50.jpg">
<img class="img2" src="assets/c.png">
<div class="content">What I have learned over the course of remote learning and quarantine, is that while something might seem easy, one can learn a lot from even the easiest things. For example, learning C, while I thought I would never do it and would never have to, was extremely beneficial towards my total understanding of computer science. Also, I learned that time, when it is made available, whether by natural circumstances or by unexpected changes, is not meant to be wasted. A pandemic on the scale of this year’s will probably never happen again in our lives, and we will never have time on this scale again. When we work 9-to-5 jobs, and arrive home to 2 kids who need feeding, schooling, and care, will time exist to take care of us?  </div>
